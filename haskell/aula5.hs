-- 1. Give another possible calculation for the result of double ( double 2)		

my_double :: Int -> Int

-- 2. Show that sum [ x ] = x for any number x .

-- resposta:
-- my_sum [1,2,3]
--          1 + my_sum[2,3]
--          1 + 2 + my_sum [3]

-- 4. How should the definition of the function qsort be modified so that it
-- produces a reverse sorted version of a list?

-- 5. What would be the effect of replacing â‰¤ by < in the definition of qsort ?
-- Hint: consider the example qsort [2, 2, 3, 1, 1].
